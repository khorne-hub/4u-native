// Gateway cheat codes (the format of Azahar's and Luma3DS's cheats files):
//
//     [Name]
//     *citra_enabled              (the cheat is on; Azahar writes it, and so does the app)
//     *a comment line
//     12345678 90ABCDEF           (one or more code lines)
//
// Execute runs a cheat's lines once, as Azahar's GatewayCheat::Execute, against a CheatTarget: the
// game's memory and the pad's state. Departures from Azahar:
//  - Azahar invalidates the JIT's cache after each write; the port's code is recompiled ahead of time
//    and never reads its instructions from memory, so a cheat that writes into the game's code does
//    nothing (TouchesCode tells such a cheat apart, for the app to say so);
//  - a patch line (EXXXXXXX) that claims more bytes than its cheat has lines stops at the last line
//    (Azahar reads past the end of its list);
//  - nothing is logged per bad line at load (the count is), and enabling a cheat logs nothing;
//  - the file is read as the community's lists write it, which Azahar leaves out: a code line's two words split by
//    tabs or several spaces, or written together, with a comment after them ("// ...", "# ...", "; ..."), is read as
//    "XXXXXXXX YYYYYYYY"; a line of "{...}" (CTRPF's notes), "# ..." or "// ..." is a comment; "[Name] text" is Name;
//    a UTF-8 mark at the start of the file is passed over.
