//
// The cheat engine (Gateway codes, gateway_cheat.h) of the running game. The boot step `started.cheats`
// (cheats_step.cpp) makes one per run, loads the title's cheats file and runs the cheats that are on once
// per game frame (Runtime::OnFrame), on the game's thread at a safe point: Azahar runs them on a timer
// event of its CPU thread, every 50,000,000 ticks (Luma3DS's interval), the port at every new frame.
//
// The app's settings change the list while the game runs (Current): a cheat turned on or off counts from
// the next frame, and Save writes the file in Azahar's format (`*citra_enabled` marks a cheat that is on),
// which Azahar reads as it is.
//
// Threads: every call may come from any thread. Run takes the list's lock shared, the others exclusive,
// for no longer than a copy of the list (Save and Import read and write their files outside it).
