// The Vulkan driver a host chooses. Without hooks the backend loads Vulkan through the system's loader, as it always
// did. A host that opened a driver of its own (the Android app: a player's GPU driver through libadrenotools,
// app_native/gpu_driver.cpp) sets the hooks before the first CreateInstance:
//   - loader: asked by each CreateInstance; the vkGetInstanceProcAddr to load Vulkan from (plume patch 14), or null
//     for the system's. An instance that can't be made with it, or that lists no GPU, is made again with the
//     system's loader, after `failed` has been told why: a broken driver doesn't stop the game.
//   - device_made: told by each CreateBackend, once its device is made, which GPU and which driver run.
//   - device_lost: told once, on whichever thread saw it, that the device is lost (VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST from a submission,
//     a fence or a wait) and where: nothing the renderer submits runs any more, and a wait for it would never end. A
//     host with no hook keeps going (the waits return at once from then on).
// Process-wide; the hooks are called on the thread that makes the instance or the device.
